3.Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omit:
    a.main
     - identifier excepted
    b.String
     - Cannot resolve symbol 'args'
     - Parameter expected
     - Identifier expected
    c.HelloWorld
     - 'class' or 'interface' expected
     - Implicitly declared classes are not supported at language level '22'
    d.System.out
     - Cannot resolve method 'println' in 'HelloWorld'
    f.println
     - Method call expected

4. Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omit
    a.the ;
     - ';' expected
    b.the first "
     - ',' or ')' expected
     - Cannot resolve symbol 'Hello' and 'World'
     - Line end not allowed in string literals
    c.the second "
     - Line end not allowed in string literals
    d.the first {
     - Duplicate class: 'HelloWorld'
     - '{' expected
     - 'class' or 'interface' expected
     - Implicitly declared classes are not supported at language level '22'
    e. the second {
     - '{' or ';' expected
     - Unexpected token
     - Cannot resolve symbol 'println'
     - 'class' or 'interface' expected
    f.the first }
     - '}' expected
    g.the second }
     - '}' expected

5. Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you misspell (by, say, omitting the second letter)
    a.main
     - your program will not run
    b.String
     - leading to a compile-time error
    c.HelloWorld
     - you will encounter errors when trying to compile or run the program
    d.System.out
     - leading to a compile-time error because System-error is not a recognized class:
    e.println
     - causing a compile-time error

6. you will be warned:
    - Method 'main()' does not have signature 'public static void main(String[])'
  String[] args is requied
